# Knee_Arthritis_Detection
This project aims to automatically detect and predict the severity of knee osteoarthritis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By leveraging medical imaging and deep learning, it supports early diagnosis and tracking of disease progression to assist radiologists and clinicians in decision-making.
